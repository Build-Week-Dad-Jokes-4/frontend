Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
  - Our app is used to entertain the user
  - This can help with boredom and sadness

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
  - By giving the user funny jokes to pass the time.

- What is the mission statement?

  - Dad’s already have enough on their plate. What better way than to kill some time reading Dad Jokes after an awesome day with the family.

Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
  - CRUD Dad Jokes for logged-in users
  - View jokes for public (non-authenticated) users

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
  - Add pic to user’s profile
  - Hide punchline of jokes until the user wants to see it

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
  - The iPhone app, “Funny dad jokes”, gives the use one joke at a time. It also displays the question and punchline at the same time.

  - www.niceonedad.com - This website display jokes and answers on slides that change when you click. They use cool animations for their slide transitions.

  - www.boredpanda.com - This website has many jokes and other forms of entertainment. It is not completely focused on dad jokes, so the number of dad jokes is limited.

Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
  - React
  - Semantic UI
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
  - No
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
  - No
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
  - N/A

For Data Scientists

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
  - Dads
  - Anyone who enjoys Dad Jokes

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
  - It sounds cool.
  - I would use it because I like dad jokes.
  
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
